# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of right now any and all versions are accepting security updates. This is a huge project and definitely wouldn't be possible without amazing people like yourselves helping to spot vulnerabilities.
I can't offer much in the way of a bug bounty, but if it's big enough, I will do my best to muster up whatever I can!!!
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be posted as either issues, in the discusstion section, or by private email (brandon@brandonmiller.io)

As said, I can't offer much in the way of a reward, but you can expect it to be taken seriously and put directly to the top of the priority list!!
